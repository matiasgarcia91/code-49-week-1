## Basic Terminal Commands

- pwd (path working directory)
- ls (list files in the current directory)
- cd (change-directory)
- . (a reference to the current directory, example `code .`)
- .. (a reference to the parent directory, example `cd ..`)
- mkdir (creates a new directory)
- touch (create files).
- rm (remove files), and if we add the `-rf` **flag** we can use it for directories.
- sudo <command> (gives the next command super user permissions)
